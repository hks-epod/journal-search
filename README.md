### Summary

November 2015. Some basic text mining of econ articles.

### Resources
* [AER](https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/issues.php)
* [Journal of Political Economy](http://www.jstor.org/journal/jpoliecon)
* [Econometrica](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/browse)


### TODO
1. `git`. 
2. Look at 2-3 top econ journals (say AER, Journal of Political Economy, and Econometrica) for the past 3-5 years (depending on how time consuming the task is)
3. Count the number of times that the word effect (or its relatives like “impact”) appears.
4. Count the number of times that the word predict (or its relatives like prediction, predicting,predicted etc) appears.
5. Count the number of times that the word forecast appears (or its relatives like forecasting) appears.
6. Tally these counts by journal and by year (in excel)
7. Tally the number of articles for which we checked (so we have a denominator)
